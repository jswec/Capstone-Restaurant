       "      <td>A small, cozy family run Authentic korean restaurant.  Chris Lee - the owner is very friendly and courteous.  The price is generally about 25% more than other restaurants in the area.\\n\\nOrdered a whole bunch of food to share including:\\n\\n1) Pork Bone Soup - $9.99\\n2) Samgyeopsal - BBQ Bacon and soup (for 2 ppl) - $32.99\\n3) &amp; 4)  Bibimbap - $??\\n5) Side dishes - Free\\n\\n\\n1) Pork bone soup is really good, the consistency of the soup is slightly thicker than what you would get from any other place.  This is because of the potatoes in the soup and is really delicious.  It used to come with the Korean multigrain \\/ five grain rice (Ogokbap), but this time they served it with white rice.  When asked, Chris said that due to the raising cost, they are now serving with white rice - Generally not a good sign when they start to cut corners.\\n\\n2) I personally don't find anything special about this dish and find it a bit over priced.  They bring a grill to your table and a whole plate of fatty pork (uncured bacon).  You grill the meat, wrap it in lettuce, put some bean paste....A-OK, nothing really wowed me.  The combo also comes with a soup.  \\n\\n3) &amp; 4) Got two different Bibimbap, one was plain rice with beef, some veggies.  They give you hot sauce  and sesame oil to add.  The second one was kim - Chee Bibimbap.  Both of them  comes with fried egg and served in traditional stone bowl.  I am not 100% sure, but I believe they were about $12.99 for each.  Once again, a bit over priced, however it was good.\\n\\n5)  Side dishes are really good and I think they make these themselves.  I particularly love their Kim Chi.  The only other place where I have seen\\/tasted this kind of kim chi is in Korea.  It's hard to explain, but this is as authentic as it's going to get.\\n\\nAll in all the food is pretty good, I would give it 3.5*.  The owner is really friendly and always checking if everything is ok.  The only complain is the price point seems to be a bit off, If it was 25% cheaper, This would be one of my regular spot.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Really nice atmosphere and settings and very clean.  The food was sub-keg and the service was definitely under par.\\n\\nWent with a group of people, after taking the initial order, our server seems to have disappeared.  We were missing some water and had to wave down another waiter to ask for our waiter.  Asked for the water, and once again he disappeared and no water.  Kindda annoying.\\n\\nSteak was unevenly cooked.  Asked for a medium well rib steak, half of my steak was medium and the other half was well......kindda gives a different meaning to medium well.  \\n\\nOne of the person in the group also found hair(s) in her food.  She opted not to eat after that, In all fairness the Manager came by to make sure if there wasn't anything he can do.  Since she was disgusted, she did not wanted a replacement.\\n\\nThe manager however offered us two pieces of cheese cake at no charge.\\n\\nAll in all, it was A-OK, the best part is the atmosphere, that's about it.</td>\n",

Cool decor and vibe inside their 30 seat restaurant. Call for a reservation. \\n\\nWe had their beef tartar and pork belly to start and a salmon dish and lamb meal for mains. Everything was incredible! I could go on at length about how all the listed ingredients really make their dishes amazing but honestly you just need to go. \\n\\nA bit outside of downtown montreal but take the metro out and it's less than a 10 minute walk from the station.   \n",

They are known for smoked meat which most deli's have but their brisket sandwich is what I come to montreal for. They've got about 12 seats outside to go along with the inside. \\n\\nThe smoked meat is up there in quality and taste with Schwartz's and you'll find less tourists at Lester's as well.   \n",

Yes the place always needs the floor swept but when you give out  peanuts in the shell how won't it always be a bit dirty. \\n\\nThe food speaks for itself, so good. Burgers are made to order and the meat is put on the grill when you order your sandwich. Getting the small burger just means 1 patty, the regular is a 2 patty burger which is twice the deliciousness. \\n\\nGetting the Cajun fries adds a bit of spice to them and whatever size you order they always throw more fries (a lot more fries) into the bag.   \n",

I asked him if I can make up my mind after I tried the gym out first, but he insisted I do it now or else the price will go up.  As a matter of fact, he has a price increase meeting tomorrow....hahaha\\n\\nDid not opt for the 'new' package, stuck with my original package.  He seemed upset...said fine, your membership expires in 4 months, you just get your membership and nothing else, you will have to pay for parking too.  I told him...but I see that there is a sign that says one hr free parking.  umm...err...ehhh...yeah, well, only one hr free, after that you will have to pay $3\\/hr.  whatever...\\n\\nAfter signing everything, he said you will get your access card after you finish your assessment (aka personal trainer sales pitch).  I told  him I do not need an assessment as I will only be using the treadmill.  He said I HAVE to get an assessment for insurance purpose....LAAAME!\\n\\nwill update after my physical assessment.   \n",

       "5261666  A small, cozy family run Authentic korean restaurant.  Chris Lee - the owner is very friendly and courteous.  The price is generally about 25% more than other restaurants in the area.\\n\\nOrdered a whole bunch of food to share including:\\n\\n1) Pork Bone Soup - $9.99\\n2) Samgyeopsal - BBQ Bacon and soup (for 2 ppl) - $32.99\\n3) & 4)  Bibimbap - $??\\n5) Side dishes - Free\\n\\n\\n1) Pork bone soup is really good, the consistency of the soup is slightly thicker than what you would get from any other place.  This is because of the potatoes in the soup and is really delicious.  It used to come with the Korean multigrain \\/ five grain rice (Ogokbap), but this time they served it with white rice.  When asked, Chris said that due to the raising cost, they are now serving with white rice - Generally not a good sign when they start to cut corners.\\n\\n2) I personally don't find anything special about this dish and find it a bit over priced.  They bring a grill to your table and a whole plate of fatty pork (uncured bacon).  You grill the meat, wrap it in lettuce, put some bean paste....A-OK, nothing really wowed me.  The combo also comes with a soup.  \\n\\n3) & 4) Got two different Bibimbap, one was plain rice with beef, some veggies.  They give you hot sauce  and sesame oil to add.  The second one was kim - Chee Bibimbap.  Both of them  comes with fried egg and served in traditional stone bowl.  I am not 100% sure, but I believe they were about $12.99 for each.  Once again, a bit over priced, however it was good.\\n\\n5)  Side dishes are really good and I think they make these themselves.  I particularly love their Kim Chi.  The only other place where I have seen\\/tasted this kind of kim chi is in Korea.  It's hard to explain, but this is as authentic as it's going to get.\\n\\nAll in all the food is pretty good, I would give it 3.5*.  The owner is really friendly and always checking if everything is ok.  The only complain is the price point seems to be a bit off, If it was 25% cheaper, This would be one of my regular spot.   \n",

The food was sub-keg and the service was definitely under par.\\n\\nWent with a group of people, after taking the initial order, our server seems to have disappeared.  We were missing some water and had to wave down another waiter to ask for our waiter.  Asked for the water, and once again he disappeared and no water.  Kindda annoying.\\n\\nSteak was unevenly cooked.  Asked for a medium well rib steak, half of my steak was medium and the other half was well......kindda gives a different meaning to medium well.  \\n\\nOne of the person in the group also found hair(s) in her food.  She opted not to eat after that, In all fairness the Manager came by to make sure if there wasn't anything he can do.  Since she was disgusted, she did not wanted a replacement.\\n\\nThe manager however offered us two pieces of cheese cake at no charge.\\n\\nAll in all, it was A-OK, the best part is the atmosphere, that's about it.   \n",

Yes the place always needs the floor swept but when you give out  peanuts in the shell how won't it always be a bit dirty. \\n\\nThe food speaks for itself, so good. Burgers are made to order and the meat is put on the grill when you order your sandwich. Getting the small burger just means 1 patty, the regular is a 2 patty burger which is twice the deliciousness. \\n\\nGetting the Cajun fries adds a bit of spice to them and whatever size you order they always throw more fries (a lot more fries) into the bag.</td>\n",

As a matter of fact, he has a price increase meeting tomorrow....hahaha\\n\\nDid not opt for the 'new' package, stuck with my original package.  He seemed upset...said fine, your membership expires in 4 months, you just get your membership and nothing else, you will have to pay for parking too.  I told him...but I see that there is a sign that says one hr free parking.  umm...err...ehhh...yeah, well, only one hr free, after that you will have to pay $3\\/hr.  whatever...\\n\\nAfter signing everything, he said you will get your access card after you finish your assessment (aka personal trainer sales pitch).

       "      <td>A small, cozy family run Authentic korean restaurant.  Chris Lee - the owner is very friendly and courteous.  The price is generally about 25% more than other restaurants in the area.\\n\\nOrdered a whole bunch of food to share including:\\n\\n1) Pork Bone Soup - $9.99\\n2) Samgyeopsal - BBQ Bacon and soup (for 2 ppl) - $32.99\\n3) &amp; 4)  Bibimbap - $??\\n5) Side dishes - Free\\n\\n\\n1) Pork bone soup is really good, the consistency of the soup is slightly thicker than what you would get from any other place.  This is because of the potatoes in the soup and is really delicious.  It used to come with the Korean multigrain \\/ five grain rice (Ogokbap), but this time they served it with white rice.  When asked, Chris said that due to the raising cost, they are now serving with white rice - Generally not a good sign when they start to cut corners.\\n\\n2) I personally don't find anything special about this dish and find it a bit over priced.  They bring a grill to your table and a whole plate of fatty pork (uncured bacon).  You grill the meat, wrap it in lettuce, put some bean paste....A-OK, nothing really wowed me.  The combo also comes with a soup.  \\n\\n3) &amp; 4) Got two different Bibimbap, one was plain rice with beef, some veggies.  They give you hot sauce  and sesame oil to add.  The second one was kim - Chee Bibimbap.  Both of them  comes with fried egg and served in traditional stone bowl.  I am not 100% sure, but I believe they were about $12.99 for each.  Once again, a bit over priced, however it was good.\\n\\n5)  Side dishes are really good and I think they make these themselves.  I particularly love their Kim Chi.  The only other place where I have seen\\/tasted this kind of kim chi is in Korea.  It's hard to explain, but this is as authentic as it's going to get.\\n\\nAll in all the food is pretty good, I would give it 3.5*.  The owner is really friendly and always checking if everything is ok.  The only complain is the price point seems to be a bit off, If it was 25% cheaper, This would be one of my regular spot.</td>\n",

It's been around since the 30's and they still serve the same thing they started with: a bologna and salami sandwich with mustard. \\n\\nStaff was very helpful and friendly.   \n",

Cool decor and vibe inside their 30 seat restaurant. Call for a reservation. \\n\\nWe had their beef tartar and pork belly to start and a salmon dish and lamb meal for mains. Everything was incredible! I could go on at length about how all the listed ingredients really make their dishes amazing but honestly you just need to go. \\n\\nA bit outside of downtown montreal but take the metro out and it's less than a 10 minute walk from the station.   \n",

They are known for smoked meat which most deli's have but their brisket sandwich is what I come to montreal for. They've got about 12 seats outside to go along with the inside. \\n\\nThe smoked meat is up there in quality and taste with Schwartz's and you'll find less tourists at Lester's as well.   \n",

Yes the place always needs the floor swept but when you give out  peanuts in the shell how won't it always be a bit dirty. \\n\\nThe food speaks for itself, so good. Burgers are made to order and the meat is put on the grill when you order your sandwich. Getting the small burger just means 1 patty, the regular is a 2 patty burger which is twice the deliciousness. \\n\\nGetting the Cajun fries adds a bit of spice to them and whatever size you order they always throw more fries (a lot more fries) into the bag.   \n",

I asked him if I can make up my mind after I tried the gym out first, but he insisted I do it now or else the price will go up.  As a matter of fact, he has a price increase meeting tomorrow....hahaha\\n\\nDid not opt for the 'new' package, stuck with my original package.  He seemed upset...said fine, your membership expires in 4 months, you just get your membership and nothing else, you will have to pay for parking too.  I told him...but I see that there is a sign that says one hr free parking.  umm...err...ehhh...yeah, well, only one hr free, after that you will have to pay $3\\/hr.  whatever...\\n\\nAfter signing everything, he said you will get your access card after you finish your assessment (aka personal trainer sales pitch).  I told  him I do not need an assessment as I will only be using the treadmill.  He said I HAVE to get an assessment for insurance purpose....LAAAME!\\n\\nwill update after my physical assessment.   \n",

       "5261666  A small, cozy family run Authentic korean restaurant.  Chris Lee - the owner is very friendly and courteous.  The price is generally about 25% more than other restaurants in the area.\\n\\nOrdered a whole bunch of food to share including:\\n\\n1) Pork Bone Soup - $9.99\\n2) Samgyeopsal - BBQ Bacon and soup (for 2 ppl) - $32.99\\n3) & 4)  Bibimbap - $??\\n5) Side dishes - Free\\n\\n\\n1) Pork bone soup is really good, the consistency of the soup is slightly thicker than what you would get from any other place.  This is because of the potatoes in the soup and is really delicious.  It used to come with the Korean multigrain \\/ five grain rice (Ogokbap), but this time they served it with white rice.  When asked, Chris said that due to the raising cost, they are now serving with white rice - Generally not a good sign when they start to cut corners.\\n\\n2) I personally don't find anything special about this dish and find it a bit over priced.  They bring a grill to your table and a whole plate of fatty pork (uncured bacon).  You grill the meat, wrap it in lettuce, put some bean paste....A-OK, nothing really wowed me.  The combo also comes with a soup.  \\n\\n3) & 4) Got two different Bibimbap, one was plain rice with beef, some veggies.  They give you hot sauce  and sesame oil to add.  The second one was kim - Chee Bibimbap.  Both of them  comes with fried egg and served in traditional stone bowl.  I am not 100% sure, but I believe they were about $12.99 for each.  Once again, a bit over priced, however it was good.\\n\\n5)  Side dishes are really good and I think they make these themselves.  I particularly love their Kim Chi.  The only other place where I have seen\\/tasted this kind of kim chi is in Korea.  It's hard to explain, but this is as authentic as it's going to get.\\n\\nAll in all the food is pretty good, I would give it 3.5*.  The owner is really friendly and always checking if everything is ok.  The only complain is the price point seems to be a bit off, If it was 25% cheaper, This would be one of my regular spot.   \n",

The food was sub-keg and the service was definitely under par.\\n\\nWent with a group of people, after taking the initial order, our server seems to have disappeared.  We were missing some water and had to wave down another waiter to ask for our waiter.  Asked for the water, and once again he disappeared and no water.  Kindda annoying.\\n\\nSteak was unevenly cooked.  Asked for a medium well rib steak, half of my steak was medium and the other half was well......kindda gives a different meaning to medium well.  \\n\\nOne of the person in the group also found hair(s) in her food.  She opted not to eat after that, In all fairness the Manager came by to make sure if there wasn't anything he can do.  Since she was disgusted, she did not wanted a replacement.\\n\\nThe manager however offered us two pieces of cheese cake at no charge.\\n\\nAll in all, it was A-OK, the best part is the atmosphere, that's about it.   \n",

Yes the place always needs the floor swept but when you give out  peanuts in the shell how won't it always be a bit dirty. \\n\\nThe food speaks for itself, so good. Burgers are made to order and the meat is put on the grill when you order your sandwich. Getting the small burger just means 1 patty, the regular is a 2 patty burger which is twice the deliciousness. \\n\\nGetting the Cajun fries adds a bit of spice to them and whatever size you order they always throw more fries (a lot more fries) into the bag.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A small, cozy family run Authentic korean restaurant.  Chris Lee - the owner is very friendly and courteous.  The price is generally about 25% more than other restaurants in the area.\\n\\nOrdered a whole bunch of food to share including:\\n\\n1) Pork Bone Soup - $9.99\\n2) Samgyeopsal - BBQ Bacon and soup (for 2 ppl) - $32.99\\n3) &amp; 4)  Bibimbap - $??\\n5) Side dishes - Free\\n\\n\\n1) Pork bone soup is really good, the consistency of the soup is slightly thicker than what you would get from any other place.  This is because of the potatoes in the soup and is really delicious.  It used to come with the Korean multigrain \\/ five grain rice (Ogokbap), but this time they served it with white rice.  When asked, Chris said that due to the raising cost, they are now serving with white rice - Generally not a good sign when they start to cut corners.\\n\\n2) I personally don't find anything special about this dish and find it a bit over priced.  They bring a grill to your table and a whole plate of fatty pork (uncured bacon).  You grill the meat, wrap it in lettuce, put some bean paste....A-OK, nothing really wowed me.  The combo also comes with a soup.  \\n\\n3) &amp; 4) Got two different Bibimbap, one was plain rice with beef, some veggies.  They give you hot sauce  and sesame oil to add.  The second one was kim - Chee Bibimbap.  Both of them  comes with fried egg and served in traditional stone bowl.  I am not 100% sure, but I believe they were about $12.99 for each.  Once again, a bit over priced, however it was good.\\n\\n5)  Side dishes are really good and I think they make these themselves.  I particularly love their Kim Chi.  The only other place where I have seen\\/tasted this kind of kim chi is in Korea.  It's hard to explain, but this is as authentic as it's going to get.\\n\\nAll in all the food is pretty good, I would give it 3.5*.  The owner is really friendly and always checking if everything is ok.  The only complain is the price point seems to be a bit off, If it was 25% cheaper, This would be one of my regular spot.</td>\n",

It's been around since the 30's and they still serve the same thing they started with: a bologna and salami sandwich with mustard. \\n\\nStaff was very helpful and friendly.   \n",

Cool decor and vibe inside their 30 seat restaurant. Call for a reservation. \\n\\nWe had their beef tartar and pork belly to start and a salmon dish and lamb meal for mains. Everything was incredible! I could go on at length about how all the listed ingredients really make their dishes amazing but honestly you just need to go. \\n\\nA bit outside of downtown montreal but take the metro out and it's less than a 10 minute walk from the station.   \n",

They are known for smoked meat which most deli's have but their brisket sandwich is what I come to montreal for. They've got about 12 seats outside to go along with the inside. \\n\\nThe smoked meat is up there in quality and taste with Schwartz's and you'll find less tourists at Lester's as well.   \n",

Yes the place always needs the floor swept but when you give out  peanuts in the shell how won't it always be a bit dirty. \\n\\nThe food speaks for itself, so good. Burgers are made to order and the meat is put on the grill when you order your sandwich. Getting the small burger just means 1 patty, the regular is a 2 patty burger which is twice the deliciousness. \\n\\nGetting the Cajun fries adds a bit of spice to them and whatever size you order they always throw more fries (a lot more fries) into the bag.   \n",

I asked him if I can make up my mind after I tried the gym out first, but he insisted I do it now or else the price will go up.  As a matter of fact, he has a price increase meeting tomorrow....hahaha\\n\\nDid not opt for the 'new' package, stuck with my original package.  He seemed upset...said fine, your membership expires in 4 months, you just get your membership and nothing else, you will have to pay for parking too.  I told him...but I see that there is a sign that says one hr free parking.  umm...err...ehhh...yeah, well, only one hr free, after that you will have to pay $3\\/hr.  whatever...\\n\\nAfter signing everything, he said you will get your access card after you finish your assessment (aka personal trainer sales pitch).

       "5261666  A small, cozy family run Authentic korean restaurant.  Chris Lee - the owner is very friendly and courteous.  The price is generally about 25% more than other restaurants in the area.\\n\\nOrdered a whole bunch of food to share including:\\n\\n1) Pork Bone Soup - $9.99\\n2) Samgyeopsal - BBQ Bacon and soup (for 2 ppl) - $32.99\\n3) & 4)  Bibimbap - $??\\n5) Side dishes - Free\\n\\n\\n1) Pork bone soup is really good, the consistency of the soup is slightly thicker than what you would get from any other place.  This is because of the potatoes in the soup and is really delicious.  It used to come with the Korean multigrain \\/ five grain rice (Ogokbap), but this time they served it with white rice.  When asked, Chris said that due to the raising cost, they are now serving with white rice - Generally not a good sign when they start to cut corners.\\n\\n2) I personally don't find anything special about this dish and find it a bit over priced.  They bring a grill to your table and a whole plate of fatty pork (uncured bacon).  You grill the meat, wrap it in lettuce, put some bean paste....A-OK, nothing really wowed me.  The combo also comes with a soup.  \\n\\n3) & 4) Got two different Bibimbap, one was plain rice with beef, some veggies.  They give you hot sauce  and sesame oil to add.  The second one was kim - Chee Bibimbap.  Both of them  comes with fried egg and served in traditional stone bowl.  I am not 100% sure, but I believe they were about $12.99 for each.  Once again, a bit over priced, however it was good.\\n\\n5)  Side dishes are really good and I think they make these themselves.  I particularly love their Kim Chi.  The only other place where I have seen\\/tasted this kind of kim chi is in Korea.  It's hard to explain, but this is as authentic as it's going to get.\\n\\nAll in all the food is pretty good, I would give it 3.5*.  The owner is really friendly and always checking if everything is ok.  The only complain is the price point seems to be a bit off, If it was 25% cheaper, This would be one of my regular spot.   \n",

The food was sub-keg and the service was definitely under par.\\n\\nWent with a group of people, after taking the initial order, our server seems to have disappeared.  We were missing some water and had to wave down another waiter to ask for our waiter.  Asked for the water, and once again he disappeared and no water.  Kindda annoying.\\n\\nSteak was unevenly cooked.  Asked for a medium well rib steak, half of my steak was medium and the other half was well......kindda gives a different meaning to medium well.  \\n\\nOne of the person in the group also found hair(s) in her food.  She opted not to eat after that, In all fairness the Manager came by to make sure if there wasn't anything he can do.  Since she was disgusted, she did not wanted a replacement.\\n\\nThe manager however offered us two pieces of cheese cake at no charge.\\n\\nAll in all, it was A-OK, the best part is the atmosphere, that's about it.   \n",

       "      <td>A small, cozy family run Authentic korean restaurant.  Chris Lee - the owner is very friendly and courteous.  The price is generally about 25% more than other restaurants in the area.\\n\\nOrdered a whole bunch of food to share including:\\n\\n1) Pork Bone Soup - $9.99\\n2) Samgyeopsal - BBQ Bacon and soup (for 2 ppl) - $32.99\\n3) &amp; 4)  Bibimbap - $??\\n5) Side dishes - Free\\n\\n\\n1) Pork bone soup is really good, the consistency of the soup is slightly thicker than what you would get from any other place.  This is because of the potatoes in the soup and is really delicious.  It used to come with the Korean multigrain \\/ five grain rice (Ogokbap), but this time they served it with white rice.  When asked, Chris said that due to the raising cost, they are now serving with white rice - Generally not a good sign when they start to cut corners.\\n\\n2) I personally don't find anything special about this dish and find it a bit over priced.  They bring a grill to your table and a whole plate of fatty pork (uncured bacon).  You grill the meat, wrap it in lettuce, put some bean paste....A-OK, nothing really wowed me.  The combo also comes with a soup.  \\n\\n3) &amp; 4) Got two different Bibimbap, one was plain rice with beef, some veggies.  They give you hot sauce  and sesame oil to add.  The second one was kim - Chee Bibimbap.  Both of them  comes with fried egg and served in traditional stone bowl.  I am not 100% sure, but I believe they were about $12.99 for each.  Once again, a bit over priced, however it was good.\\n\\n5)  Side dishes are really good and I think they make these themselves.  I particularly love their Kim Chi.  The only other place where I have seen\\/tasted this kind of kim chi is in Korea.  It's hard to explain, but this is as authentic as it's going to get.\\n\\nAll in all the food is pretty good, I would give it 3.5*.  The owner is really friendly and always checking if everything is ok.  The only complain is the price point seems to be a bit off, If it was 25% cheaper, This would be one of my regular spot.</td>\n",

It's been around since the 30's and they still serve the same thing they started with: a bologna and salami sandwich with mustard. \\n\\nStaff was very helpful and friendly.   \n",

Cool decor and vibe inside their 30 seat restaurant. Call for a reservation. \\n\\nWe had their beef tartar and pork belly to start and a salmon dish and lamb meal for mains. Everything was incredible! I could go on at length about how all the listed ingredients really make their dishes amazing but honestly you just need to go. \\n\\nA bit outside of downtown montreal but take the metro out and it's less than a 10 minute walk from the station.   \n",

They are known for smoked meat which most deli's have but their brisket sandwich is what I come to montreal for. They've got about 12 seats outside to go along with the inside. \\n\\nThe smoked meat is up there in quality and taste with Schwartz's and you'll find less tourists at Lester's as well.   \n",

Yes the place always needs the floor swept but when you give out  peanuts in the shell how won't it always be a bit dirty. \\n\\nThe food speaks for itself, so good. Burgers are made to order and the meat is put on the grill when you order your sandwich. Getting the small burger just means 1 patty, the regular is a 2 patty burger which is twice the deliciousness. \\n\\nGetting the Cajun fries adds a bit of spice to them and whatever size you order they always throw more fries (a lot more fries) into the bag.   \n",

I asked him if I can make up my mind after I tried the gym out first, but he insisted I do it now or else the price will go up.  As a matter of fact, he has a price increase meeting tomorrow....hahaha\\n\\nDid not opt for the 'new' package, stuck with my original package.  He seemed upset...said fine, your membership expires in 4 months, you just get your membership and nothing else, you will have to pay for parking too.  I told him...but I see that there is a sign that says one hr free parking.  umm...err...ehhh...yeah, well, only one hr free, after that you will have to pay $3\\/hr.  whatever...\\n\\nAfter signing everything, he said you will get your access card after you finish your assessment (aka personal trainer sales pitch).

       "5261666  A small, cozy family run Authentic korean restaurant.  Chris Lee - the owner is very friendly and courteous.  The price is generally about 25% more than other restaurants in the area.\\n\\nOrdered a whole bunch of food to share including:\\n\\n1) Pork Bone Soup - $9.99\\n2) Samgyeopsal - BBQ Bacon and soup (for 2 ppl) - $32.99\\n3) & 4)  Bibimbap - $??\\n5) Side dishes - Free\\n\\n\\n1) Pork bone soup is really good, the consistency of the soup is slightly thicker than what you would get from any other place.  This is because of the potatoes in the soup and is really delicious.  It used to come with the Korean multigrain \\/ five grain rice (Ogokbap), but this time they served it with white rice.  When asked, Chris said that due to the raising cost, they are now serving with white rice - Generally not a good sign when they start to cut corners.\\n\\n2) I personally don't find anything special about this dish and find it a bit over priced.  They bring a grill to your table and a whole plate of fatty pork (uncured bacon).  You grill the meat, wrap it in lettuce, put some bean paste....A-OK, nothing really wowed me.  The combo also comes with a soup.  \\n\\n3) & 4) Got two different Bibimbap, one was plain rice with beef, some veggies.  They give you hot sauce  and sesame oil to add.  The second one was kim - Chee Bibimbap.  Both of them  comes with fried egg and served in traditional stone bowl.  I am not 100% sure, but I believe they were about $12.99 for each.  Once again, a bit over priced, however it was good.\\n\\n5)  Side dishes are really good and I think they make these themselves.  I particularly love their Kim Chi.  The only other place where I have seen\\/tasted this kind of kim chi is in Korea.  It's hard to explain, but this is as authentic as it's going to get.\\n\\nAll in all the food is pretty good, I would give it 3.5*.  The owner is really friendly and always checking if everything is ok.  The only complain is the price point seems to be a bit off, If it was 25% cheaper, This would be one of my regular spot.   \n",

The food was sub-keg and the service was definitely under par.\\n\\nWent with a group of people, after taking the initial order, our server seems to have disappeared.  We were missing some water and had to wave down another waiter to ask for our waiter.  Asked for the water, and once again he disappeared and no water.  Kindda annoying.\\n\\nSteak was unevenly cooked.  Asked for a medium well rib steak, half of my steak was medium and the other half was well......kindda gives a different meaning to medium well.  \\n\\nOne of the person in the group also found hair(s) in her food.  She opted not to eat after that, In all fairness the Manager came by to make sure if there wasn't anything he can do.  Since she was disgusted, she did not wanted a replacement.\\n\\nThe manager however offered us two pieces of cheese cake at no charge.\\n\\nAll in all, it was A-OK, the best part is the atmosphere, that's about it.   \n",
